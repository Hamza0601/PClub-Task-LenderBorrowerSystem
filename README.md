# PClub-Task-LenderBorrowerSystem
The program implements the system by allowing both the lenders and borrowers to register themselves on the system. They are asked about their personal details and time amount etc the rate at which the lender charges for the money, the type of interest the lender takes. Moreover the programs allow the lenders to have and see the list of people with contact to whom they have lended the money to and the borrowers lists the data of various sources from whom they have borrowed the money from. The program is interactive.
# It is a centralised system
## Demerits of a centralized system are as follows:
- Apart from the charges between the lender and borrower addtional charges needs to be payed to the service provider.
- The central server may fool its user by modifying the software leading to scam them and then running away.
- Since only one server is there when the server is down for maintenance a lot of difficulties will be faced by its users.
- If due to some reasons the system fails then the whole data is lost causing a lot of trouble and defeating the purpose of the server.
